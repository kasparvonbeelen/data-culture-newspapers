        "- **Privacy:**: You might not want to share your data (and ideas) with companies such as OpenAI;\n",
        "- **Cost:** Making abstraction of the caveat above, using open-source models might reduce costs if you want to apply for example a prompt to 10k newspaper articles;\n",
        "- **Transparency:** Be mindful that there are different gradations of openness and transparency. Even when you can access the model weights, you might remain in the dark about training data and other factors);\n",
        "- **Flexibility:** Even though some providers allow you to train or fine-tune closed models on your data (ties in with privacy), open-source models still give you more freedom and wiggle room to build new models and applications.\n",
